    <h2>5 Questions to ask before hiring a new Propane Gas Company</h2>

</div>
<div class="about">
    <h3>1: What are the fees for becoming a new customer?</h3>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, becoming a new customer is never free. There are often
        delivery, installation, and tank rental fees required when you sign on
        to become a customer. At Blue Ridge Propane, we do not charge an annual
         tank rental fee, but instead have a minimum annual requirement for the purchase 
         of propane.  Depending on the size tank that is set for your needs, there is a 
         corresponding dollar amount of propane that you must purchase per year; which equates
          to approximately one tank of propane per year.
          Our heating season year runs from June 1 through the following May 31.

    <h3>2: What payment and budget plans do you offer?</h3>
    <p>
        Propane is a price-based commodity. There’s no question more tempting to
        ask over the phone with a prospective propane provider than “what’s your
        price?”<br /><br />
        Careful: If you only base your decision on price per gallon, you might
        find yourself signed on with a cheap, low-quality propane gas
        company.<br /><br />
        Instead of judging the face value of the price per gallon, consider how
        the propane company will help you manage payments in the long-term. Ask
        about their payment plan options that help out your monthly budget.
    </p>
    <ul>
        For Example:<br /><br />
        <li>
            Even Monthly Payments – pay the same amount each month for your
            propane bill. The budget program begins in August each year and 
            runs through May.  Call our office for details so that we can customize 
            your budget plan specific for your average usage. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Pre-buy Programs – avoid price spikes by buying propane in advance. 
            This price for pre-buy is set in July, and is available for purchase
             from August 1 through September 15th, before the beginning of heating season.
        </li>
        <li>
            Automatic Payments – schedule automatic monthly payments at
            convenient times with a payment method of your choice.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Propane prices change with the seasons. A budget plan, such as even
        monthly payments for a whole year could give you serious peace of mind
        when considering your monthly usage multiplied by fluctuating propane
        prices.

    <h3>3: What other services do you offer besides propane delivery?</h3>
    <p>
        Some propane companies stick to filling up your tank every month and
        sending you the bill. Blue Ridge Propane has a wider scope of services to help
        you handle emergency situations, ongoing appliance maintenance, and even
        home improvements.
    </p>
    <ul>
        Depending on your home fueling needs, you might consider:<br /><br />
        <li>
            Regular Monthly Auto Fill – This is our preferred method of delivery.
             We top off your tank monthly in the winter months, then not as often in the summer. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Gas Line Checks – ensure your home is safe from propane
            gas leaks.
        </li>
        <li>
            Appliance Tune-ups – Regular maintenance for your propane appliances 
            is recommended on an annual basis, and every two years for tankless water heaters.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        One of the biggest deal breakers is whether a provider offers the
        services you need. Why sign on with a propane delivery company if they
        don’t cover every service you’re looking for?  Blue Ridge Propane is confident 
        that we can meet your service and delivery needs, and would be glad to speak 
        with you further about your propane utilization.

    <h3>4: Will you help me monitor my usage?</h3>
    <p>
        A propane company that helps you monitor your monthly usage is looking
        out for your investment, whether a primary residence, seasonal residence 
        or business.<br /><br />
        They may offer an automatic refill program, so you don’t have to worry
        about scheduling refills. Or they may offer a propane tank monitor to
        tell you how much propane you use per month, as well as how many monthly
        refills:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You need to heat your home each month</li>
        <li>You can afford each month & whether to dial down usage</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Blue Ridge Propane offers both of these resources, and monitors your 
    past usage to make sure that deliveries are on target for the current season. 
        Hopefully, this question will lead to talk about the resources your
        prospective propane company offers to monitor usage and help you
        moderate it. A propane provider that lends a hand in this way is
        trustworthy and dependable.

<div class="about">
    <h3>5: What are the terms if I decide to switch?</h3>
    <p>
        If everything checks out up to this point, great—but don’t forget to
        discuss the details of terminating your contract in case it doesn’t work
        out. You want to avoid hidden termination fees. This could incur an additional 
        final expense, and end up costing more than budgeted to switch providers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Not only should you consider the cancellation cost, but fees for tank
        removal and propane gas pump out. Some companies will let you keep the
        tank when ending a contract, but they will pump out the propane in your
        tank and charge you for it. Others might let you keep both, others
        remove both and hand you a big bill.
    </p>
    <p>
        Look out for the fine print. Before signing on with any propane company,
        make sure you understand the terms of switching from one provider to
        another.
    </p>

<div class="about">
    <h3>Smart questions help you find your ideal propane provider</h3>
    <p>
        Write down your propane service “musts” before making any calls and,
        when on a call, always prod for more information.
    </p>
    <p>
        A reliable propane provider will have no problem answering your
        questions (whether it’s over the phone or on their website). This way, you can feel assured you won’t have buyer’s
        remorse after signing on with a new propane gas company.
